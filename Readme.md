## Overview
RPi_Pico_WAV_Player is WAV player for Raspberry Pi Pico.

This project features:
* Playback for 44.1KHz 16bit Stereo WAV format 
* SD Card interface (exFAT supported)
* 160x80 LCD display
* UI Control by 3 GPIO buttons or Headphone Remote Control Buttons
* Display Tag information by LIST chunk in WAV File
* Display Coverart image by JPEG file
* Volume Control Function by fully utilizing 32bit DAC range

## Supported Board and Peripheral Devices
* Raspberry Pi Pico
* ST7735S 0.96" 160x80 LCD
* PCM5102 32bit I2S Audio DAC

## Pin Assignment & Connection
### PCM5102
| Pico Pin # | GPIO | Function | Connection |
----|----|----|----
| 21 | GP16 | BCK | to PCM5102 BCK (13) |
| 22 | GP17 | LRCK | to PCM5102 LRCK (15) |
| 23 | GND | GND | GND |
| 24 | GP18 | SDO | to PCM5102 DIN (14) |
| 32 | GP27 | AUDIO_DAC_ENABLE | to PCM5102 XSMT (17) |
| 36 / 40 | 3V3(OUT) / VBUS | VCC | to VIN of PCM5102 board |

From DAC noise's point of view, it is recommended to provide the power of PCM5102 from VBUS (5V).
For battery operation, use 3V3(OUT) pin as described in schematic.

#### PCM5102 Board Setting
* tie PCM5102 SCK (12) to low (bridge short land)
* H1L (FLT) = L
* H2L (DEMP) = L
* H3L (XSMT): Remove the bridge to H and connect GP27
* H4L (FMT) = L

### ST7735S LCD driver
| Pico Pin # | GPIO | Function | Connection |
----|----|----|----
| 12 | GP9 | GPIO | BLK |
| 14 | GP10 | SPI1_SCK | SCL |
| 15 | GP11 | SPI1_TX | SDA |
| 17 | GP13 | SPI1_CSn | CS |
| 18 | GND | GND | GND |
| 19 | GP14 | GPIO | DC |
| 20 | GP15 | GPIO | RES |
| 36 | 3V3(OUT) | 3.3V | VCC |

### SD Card interface
| Pico Pin # | GPIO | Function | Connection |
----|----|----|----
|  4 | GP2 | SPI0_SCK | CLK (5) |
|  5 | GP3 | SPI0_TX | CMD (3) |
|  6 | GP4 | SPI0_RX | DAT0 (7) |
|  7 | GP5 | SPI0_CSn | CD/DAT3 (2) |
|  8 | GND | GND | VSS (6) |
| 36 | 3V3(OUT) | 3.3V | VDD (4) |

#### Caution
* SPI0_TX and SPI0_RX needs to be pull-ed up with 10Kohm.
* Wire length between Pico and SD card is very sensitive. Short wiring as possible is desired, otherwise access errors  will occur.

### Control Switches
At least either of GPIO Push Buttons or Headphone Remote Control Buttons need to be implemented.

| Pico Pin # | GPIO | Function | Connection |
----|----|----|----
| 26 | GP20 | GPIO | Push Button (Minus) |
| 29 | GP22 | GPIO | Push Button (Plus) |
| 31 | GP26 | ADC0 | Headphone Remote Control (MIC pin) and/or Push Button (Center)|

* When GPIO Push Buttons are not implemented, pull up GP20 and GP22 with 4.7Kohm x 2.
* When Headphone Remote Control Buttons are not implemented, pull up GP26 with 2.2Kohm.

## How to build
* See ["Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico"](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)
* Put "pico-sdk", "pico-examples" and "pico-extras" on the same level with this project folder.
* Set environmental variables for PICO_SDK_PATH, PICO_EXTRAS_PATH
* Build is confirmed in Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022 and Visual Studio Code on Windows enviroment
* Confirmed with Pico SDK 1.5.1, cmake-3.27.2-windows-x86_64 and gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-win32
```

## Button Control Guide
UI Control is available with GPIO 3 push switches or 3 button Headphone Remote Control.
For Headphone Remote Control, Connect MIC pin to GP26 of Raspberry Pi Pico.
GP26 also needs to be pulled-up by 2.2Kohm from 3.3V. See schematic for detail.
